# es0hack

> info

esohack is a client i started because im on holiday and have nothing to do. i also want to use it as a learning experience. 
this repo is just for bugs/feature requests (read below), as i would like to keep the project closed source until i decide to stop working on it.

> bugs/feature requests

if you would like to report a bug or request a feature, create an issue (https://github.com/es0-dev/es0hack-issues/issues) and at the beginning of the title, put either [bug] or [request]. please include only 1 bug or 1 suggestion per issue, so i can keep track of everything a lot easier - otherwise i may forget to include the other things you request.

thanks for reading gamers :^)
